# FunkyProfz - A Fun and Functional Discord Bot! 

FunkyProfz is a lightweight Discord bot packed with small but engaging features. Built with simplicity and fun in mind, this bot uses the `!` prefix to execute a variety of commands, integrates with the Giphy API, and even generates secure keys!

## Features
### **Command Prefix: `!`**
- `!funky`: Searches Giphy for "feeling funky" GIFs and responds with a random pick.
- `!blob`: Always responds with the iconic Blob GIF and messages like:
  - *"What's up with the Blob?"*
  - *"Are you blobbing or what?"*
- `!gm` / `!gn`: Sends random Good Morning / Good Night messages with GIFs to match.

### 🔊 **Custom Discord Activity**
- Set the bot's activity to:
  - Watching, Listening, or Streaming anything you want!
  - Easily changeable via commands.

### 🔐 **Secure Key Generation (GenKeys)**
